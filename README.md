# pcube
pcube is a framework that provides a set of primitives to simplify the development of P4-based dataplane applications.
pcube currently supports P4-14 but could be easily extended to P4-16.

This project was published in the IEEE ICNP 2018 workshop P4EU. The paper is available [here](https://www.akashtrehan.com/assets/pcube/pcube-icnp18.pdf) and the workshop presentation slides are [here](https://www.akashtrehan.com/assets/pcube/pcube-slides-icnp18.pdf)
